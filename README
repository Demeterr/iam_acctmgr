aws_acctmgr
===========

``aws_acctmgr`` synchronizes a local NSS database against Amazon Web Services
(AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the primary use-case of
providing SSH access to AWS EC2 instances for remote administrators [1].

This relies on a new SSH Public Key metadata feature recently added to AWS IAM.
Note that the AWS documentation currently only mentions this feature in the
context of the AWS CodeCommit product but the API naming itself has no such
context.

See:
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetSSHPublicKey.html
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListSSHPublicKeys.html


[1] If LDAP is overkill.  If LDAP is not, consider ``nsscache``.


Installation
------------

These instructions have been tested with Debian 8 (Jessie) but should be fairly
general.

IAM users are not added to the system via traditional mechanisms (e.g.
``/etc/passwd``).  Instead they are registered in a dedicated directory
provided by the "libnss-extrausers" package.  The host's ``/etc/nsswitch``
should have ``extrausers`` appended to the ``passwd`` and ``shadow`` entries.

    passwd:         compat extrausers
    group:          compat
    shadow:         compat extrausers
    gshadow:        files

    hosts:          files dns
    networks:       files

    protocols:      db files
    services:       db files
    ethers:         db files
    rpc:            db files

    netgroup:       nis

Additionally, "libpam-modules" is required only if home directories should only
be created on-demand.  On Debian systems, ensure that the line::

    session required pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel/ umask=0022

Is added to ``etc/pam.d/common-account``.
